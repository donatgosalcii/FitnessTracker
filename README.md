# FitnessTracker

FitnessTracker is a web application built with ASP.NET Core 8.0 using Clean Architecture principles. It allows users to track their fitness activities—such as logging workouts, exercises, and workout sets—in a secure and extensible platform.

---

## Project Goals

- Log and manage workouts and exercises.
- Track sets with reps, weights, and durations.
- Provide user authentication via Identity and JWT.
- Offer both Razor Pages UI and API access.

## Authentication Overview

- **ASP.NET Core Identity (Cookies):** Used for UI session auth (Razor Pages).
- **JWT Bearer Token:** Used for backend API auth (issued on login, stored in HttpOnly cookie).
- **Mixed-Mode Auth:** Configured to support both seamlessly.

---

## Features

### Account Management
- Register/Login/Logout with secure password handling
- Role-based access control (User, Admin)
- JWT-based token issuance with expiration and claims

### Muscle Groups (Admin-only)
- CRUD operations via API and UI
- Linked to exercises

### Exercises (Admin-only)
- Create/Edit/Delete exercises with associated muscle groups
- Uses multi-select UI components
- Visible in workout forms

### Workouts (Users)
- Log new workouts with multiple sets
- View workout history and details
- Edit and delete past workouts
- Dynamic client-side JavaScript for managing sets

---

## Configuration

### `appsettings.json`

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Database=FitnessTrackerDb;User Id=sa;Password=YourPasswordHere;"
},
"JwtSettings": {
  "Secret": "YourSuperSecretKeyHere",
  "Issuer": "http://localhost:5179",
  "Audience": "http://localhost:5179",
  "ExpiryMinutes": 60
}
```

### `launchSettings.json`
```json
"applicationUrl": "https://localhost:7115;http://localhost:5179"
```

## Testing Status

| Area                  | Status   |
|-----------------------|----------|
| Account API           | Tested via Postman/UI |
| MuscleGroup API/UI    | Working & verified    |
| Exercise API/UI       | Working & verified    |
| Workout Logging       | Working with dynamic JS |
| Workout Editing       | In Progress (currently being tested) |

---

## Known Issues / Workarounds

- HTTPS redirect may fail due to local dev certs; HTTP used by default.
- JWT Bearer cookies stored as `HttpOnly` to prevent XSS access.
- WorkoutSet editing uses a "delete-and-reinsert" pattern for simplicity.
- UI pages currently built for desktop browser usage.

---

## Next Steps

- Complete Edit Workout Testing
- Add server/client-side validations (FluentValidation)
- Implement structured logging (e.g., Serilog)
- Write unit and integration tests
- Improve error handling and user messages
- Add Swagger for API documentation
- Deploy with Docker + CI/CD
